Annex B: Compensation Scheme.

# The purpose of Annex B is to set up the compensation scheme. Meaning, both how and 
# the payment is made. This means that we need to define specific payments and that we
# need to also address the risks of an unsuccessful funding. 


Definitions:

	Successful Funding: meaning, the raising of at least 500ETH via the Token Generating Event, or the participation of at least 500 unique ETH addresses in the Token Generating Event, whichever is earlier.

	Token Generating Event: meaning, the sale of ETH tokens by Alice to the public based on the whitepaper listed at http://vnutoken.io/whitepaper.pdf, which shall be made no later than March 1st, 2019.

Upon a Successful Funding, Alice shall pay Bob a sum of 5ETH, as well as 5,000 VNU tokens, or the equivalent of USD5,000 in ETH, whichever is higher (the â€œCompensation).

Should Bob only perform Stage 1 in Annex A, the sum shall be 15% of the Compensation.

Should Bob perform Stages 1 and 2 in Annex A, the sum shall be 35% of the Compensation.
